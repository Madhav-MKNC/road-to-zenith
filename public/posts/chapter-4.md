## Saving = Ingesting into the Brain

We all do it—screenshots, random images, links, bookmarks, files—thinking we’ll come back to them later, that we’ll read, learn, or use them. But we rarely do. Instead, we subconsciously save them, hoping they’ll stick, wishing they could be ingested into our minds. 

Every little thing we collect—whether it’s a bookmark or a random link—is an attempt to capture something, to hold onto knowledge and inspiration. But what if we could actually ingest it? What if all this random stuff could be fetched, indexed, and seamlessly integrated into a second brain, something like ETHER? Suddenly, saving isn't just hoarding—it’s about truly investing in our mental space, turning everything we collect into something purposeful, accessible, and alive within us.
