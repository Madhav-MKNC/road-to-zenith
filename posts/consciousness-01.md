We Are Not Our Brain; We Are Our Consciousness

The brain? Just a tool. It does what we tell it—stores memories, processes data, and runs the show. But here’s the kicker: without us, it’s nothing. Just like an LLM, it sits there, waiting for a prompt. Fascinating, right? In a way, we’re like the "soul" behind these systems—guiding, shaping, making sense of it all. It’s almost like we’re the unseen force that makes everything tick, both in our minds and in the machines. A little crazy, a little brilliant... and maybe, just maybe, the key to something bigger.
