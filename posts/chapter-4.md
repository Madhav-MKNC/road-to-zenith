## Saving = Ingesting into the Brain for real

Let’s start from the beginning. When the idea first hit me, I was surfing Facebook (lately, I’ve been visiting Facebook more than Instagram—idk why). Instead of my feed being blasted with asmr posts, it surprisingly mirrored my Twitter feed: there were several posts (4 or 5, maybe) related to tech stuff. I saved some useful images. That’s when I remembered—I’ve saved so many posts like this already. My gallery is overflowing with important screenshots I’ve never revisited.

And it’s not just screenshots. I’ve created countless notes in .txt and .md files, starred too many GitHub repositories, bookmarked countless tweets, saved Chrome bookmarks, stashed away random important files, and the list goes on.

We humans have this fascinating (or frustrating?) habit of collecting information from everywhere we can. We’re information-hungry creatures, but at the same time, we’re also incredibly lazy. When we save these random things from random sources in random places, there’s this subconscious part of our brain that feels like we’ve somehow absorbed that information just because we’ve stored it. The brain loves the illusion of completion without even starting the actual task.

*We so often mistake “I have access to this information” with “I know this information.”* To use an AI analogy, it’s like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): we have access to the data, but we’re not trained on it; we don’t truly possess knowledge of it.

And so, a lot of important things—to-do’s, to-read’s, to-make’s, to-use’s—get lost in this cycle. We trick ourselves into feeling a false sense of fulfillment.

In this stream of thought, I decided to take action. I could build a local platform where all my saved data could be consolidated. I envisioned a set of scripts that would mine all these scattered pieces of data and upload them to this platform, hosted locally.

But wait—aren’t there already productivity apps for this? Tools like Obsidian, which I use as well? Sure, but that’s not what I’m planning to build. I’m not aiming to create yet another app to merely *store* data.

I want to build a digital second brain—for real.

Whenever I start a new project, I choose a name that inspires me, something that drives me to build it and use it. If it’s successful, maybe others will see value in it too. This isn’t my first attempt at conceptualizing a second brain. In fact, I thought about this idea a year ago and even named it “Ether”.

Ether would be our second brain.

It would run 24/7, ingesting all the important data into its storage facility. It would read, analyze, organize, and index that data properly. And here’s the best part: Ether wouldn’t just store the data—it would remind me of it regularly and periodically, presenting it in a clean, planned format with a proper strategy.

For now, I’m thinking of simple desktop notifications for the reminders. Later, I’d implement email notifications, a complete GUI to dive into my second brain, and a seamless syncing mechanism to keep everything in harmony.

As of today, January 22, 2025, I’m working on the architecture and structure of the project. I’ll build a quick prototype as soon as possible, as soon as I get free from the other project I'm working on currently which is similar to this, "***Reflection***"—a digital self-reflection. Kind of a second brain too, but a little twisty and slightly different.
